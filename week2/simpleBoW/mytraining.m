% MYTRAINING 
% implementation of BoW algorithm for classification task on CARs and FACEs
%
% inputs:
%   k: parameter k for k-means clustering
%
% outputs:
%   FOREST: k-d tree with k-means centers
%   C: k-means centeros
%   BOW_matrix_cars: histgram of CARs
%   BOW_matrix_faces: histgram of FACEs
%
% Note,
% (1) make sure you have /cars and /faces dataset under this folder
% (2) make sure you add subfolder into addpath
% (3) install vlfeat by yourself or use the (provided) previous version of vlfeat(http://www.vlfeat.org/overview/sift.html)
% (4) you may use your own clustering, or use k-means provided by vlfeat lib
% (5) all you need to modify is in TODOs, please search for TODOs

% TODOs:
% now you have centers (codewords) 
%
% you can start to compute the histogram for each training image (/cars, and /faces)
% (1) First, for each image you extract sift descriptors
% (2) then for each extracted descriptor, use kd-tree above to query for index
% (3) build the histogram with all descriptor for one image (remember to normalize it)
% (4) collect all histogram in BOW_matrix_cars and BOW_matrix_faces
%
% hint: BOW_matrix_cars and BOW_matrix_faces are both k by number of images
